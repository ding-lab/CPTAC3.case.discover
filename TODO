## Look into missing cases:
* C3L-00395
* C3L-00401
* C3L-00589
* C3L-00598
* C3L-00599
* C3L-00622
* C3L-00625
* C3L-00640
* others...

## minor issues

queryGDC seems to get an error if -vv passed

## Look at dat/cases/C3L-01069/log.C3L-01069.err
* Be sure empty cases like C3L-01069 run cleanly


## Update documentation

## Test summarize_cases.sh
 - look at buccal, peripheral blood, etc.  Add these cases as T, A, etc. 

# overnight run 11/5/19
Number of errors like,
    dat/cases/C3L-00807/log.C3L-00807.err

These are caused by harmonized reads not existing:
    ERROR: dat/cases/C3L-00807/harmonized_reads.dat does not exist or is empty
    Fatal error. Exiting

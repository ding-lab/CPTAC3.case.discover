## Look into missing cases:
* C3L-00395
* C3L-00401
* C3L-00589
* C3L-00598
* C3L-00599
* C3L-00622
* C3L-00625
* C3L-00640
* others...

## minor issues

queryGDC seems to get an error if -vv passed

## Look at dat/cases/C3L-01069/log.C3L-01069.err
* Be sure empty cases like C3L-01069 run cleanly


## Update documentation

## Test summarize_cases.sh
 - look at buccal, peripheral blood, etc.  Add these cases as T, A, etc. 

# overnight run 11/4/19
* Many errors like this:
WARNING: AR file ./dat/cases/C3L-00819/AR.dat for case C3L-00819 does not exist

## Diving in
cases moved to cases.20191104 for safe keeping, analyzing only C3L-00017

The following error occurs:
```
bash src/get_submitted_reads.sh -o dat/cases/C3L-00017/submitted_reads.dat -v dat/cases/C3L-00017/read_groups.dat

...
RESULT: { "data": { "submitted_aligned_reads": [ { "data_format": "BAM", "experimental_strategy": "WXS", "file_name": "CPT0000250005_1.WholeExome.RP-1303.bam", "file_size": 52414701226, "id": "6004cd9d-9c4e-4259-b57c-1ab203015d2a", "md5sum": "d9c4ba97a0e9b59eefec9558051348c4" } ] } }
ERROR: Unknown Experimental Strategy Targeted Sequencing

```
This is based on the following line in read_groups.dat:
```
C3L-00017   CPT0000250005_1 HWWYNCCXY190708.1.RP-1303.PDO-18786.CPT0000250005_1.bam Targeted Sequencing CPT0000250005_1.CustomSelection.RP-1303.PDO-18786.bam   null
```

-> We are getting the value "Targeted Sequencing" for a read_group library_strategy, which is legal but unexpected

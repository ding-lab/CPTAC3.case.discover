## Look into missing cases:
* C3L-00395
* C3L-00401
* C3L-00589
* C3L-00598
* C3L-00599
* C3L-00622
* C3L-00625
* C3L-00640
* others...

## Integrate demographics into main script, summary report as separate script is OK

## Look at dat/cases/C3L-01069/log.C3L-01069.err
* this ends with the error:
    ERROR: dat/cases/C3L-01069/aliquots.dat does not exist or is empty
* This is apparently caused because there are no aliquots for this case:
    dat/cases/C3L-01069/aliquots.dat is empty. Skipping case
    CPTAC3.case.discover/process_case.sh: line 138: return: can only `return' from a function or sourced script
* Be sure to make sure empty cases run cleanly

## Update documentation

Development of methylation discovery

## Plan
Plan: need to get Raw Methylation Array details based on aliquot
Details about raw_methylation_array:
    https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=raw_methylation_array

## library_strategy = Targeted Sequencing

Will treat this internally like a WXS

Example:
    Case: C3L-00017
    Aliquot: CPT0000250005_1
    Read Group Submitter ID: HWWYNCCXY190708.1.RP-1303.PDO-18786.CPT0000250005_1.bam
    Library strategy: Targeted Sequencing
    Experiment naame: CPT0000250005_1.CustomSelection.RP-1303.PDO-18786.bam
